Assignment 6


I set up a subdirectory on my laptop called 'thesis_'.

This subdirectory contains all my data from the last two practicals. 

All my files are in the directory HIVfiles within the thesis_ directoryhttps://github.com/hanmurph:

fastqc_files.py
fastqc_out
README.txt
test_dataset
testdata.tar
trimm_script.py
trim_out


Using git:
git was installed previously. 

   'git init' to initialize local repository
    
    
   'git status' to see what the current status of the repository is 
    
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.ipynb_checkpoints/
	HIVfiles/
	ass6_20234738_notes.md
	prac21_20234738.tar

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
