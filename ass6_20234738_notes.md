Assignment 6


I set up a subdirectory on my laptop called 'thesis_'.

This subdirectory contains all my data from the last two practicals. 

All my files are in the directory HIVfiles within the thesis_ directoryhttps://github.com/hanmurph:

fastqc_files.py
fastqc_out
README.txt
test_dataset
testdata.tar
trimm_script.py
trim_out


Using git:
git was installed previously. 

   'git init' to initialize local repository
    
    
   'git status' to see what the current status of the repository is 
    
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.ipynb_checkpoints/
	HIVfiles/
	ass6_20234738_notes.md
	prac21_20234738.tar

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

   'git add HIVfiles/'
   
   'git commit -m "Initial commit of all files from fastqc&trimm MA5114 practicles" '
   
   'git remote add origin https://github.com/hanmurph/thesis_.git '
   'git branch -M main'
   'git push -u origin main'
   'git log'
   
       commit c24dbe6cd54725d93aa68c11ac83deff1b581222 (HEAD -> main, origin/main)

Did not manage to upload the markdown document via the terminal:..

 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/hanmurph/thesis_.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Uploaded the markdown manually.
